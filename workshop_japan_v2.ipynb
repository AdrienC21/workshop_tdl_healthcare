        "Topological Deep Learning (TDL) and Geometric Deep Learning (GDL) are two new and emerging subfields within the broader fields of machine learning and deep learning that focus on incorporating topological and geometric information into the learning process. Such information is often refered to as **inductive bias**. The idea behind is that, by including such information, the performance of the resulting model will increase.\n",
        "\n",
        "TDL is the combination of (algebraic) topology and machine learning or deep learning. This combination generally consists of transforming the data into topological representations that capture its underlying structure. These modified data are then combined with algorithms, often neural networks, thus improving sometimes their ability to handle complex and high-dimensional data.\n",
        "\n",
        "GDL and TDL sometimes refer to the same things. However, GDL mostly refers to learning from unconventional sources of data with different geometric structures, such as graphs, point clouds, meshes, and manifolds.\n",
        "\n",
        "Overall, the aim of topological deep learning is to create neural network architectures that are invariant or equivariant to certain transformations (as the original objects are). Mathematically, let $f$ be a scalar function, $F$ be a vector function, $X$ be a node feature matrix, $A$ and adjacency matrix, and $\\mathcal{P}$ the set of all the permutations of nodes. The invariance and equivariance are defined by:\n",

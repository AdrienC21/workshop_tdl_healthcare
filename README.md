This workshop has been developed as part of a workshop for the [3rd Big Data Machine Learning in Healthcare in Japan@TMDU](https://datathon-japan.jp/2023tokyo) event that took place in Tokyo in 2023.

**Overview of the workshop:**

Topological Deep Learning and Geometric Deep Learning (TDL/GDL) are emerging fields at the intersection of mathematics, computer science, and artificial intelligence. This workshop aims to introduce participants to the principles and applications of these two fields in the context of healthcare.

First, an introduction to the fundamental concepts will be made. This approach focuses on extending traditional deep learning techniques to handle different data structures such as graphs, meshes, and point clouds. Participants will learn about graph neural networks, higher-order networks, and other architectures. The second part of the workshop will delve into the potential applications these fields in healthcare. The applications include drug discovery, molecule properties prediction and diagnosis of some diseases. Participants will have the opportunity to engage in hands-on activities through a notebook and interactive discussions.

By the end of the workshop, attendees will be equipped with the knowledge to explore these exciting fields further and apply its techniques to tackle real-world healthcare challenges.

Bringing a laptop will be essential for experimenting with the notebook. While some experience in computer science and/or mathematics is beneficial to understand some concepts, the workshop will be designed to be accessible to a wide audience.

## Workshop

### Introduction

This workshop consists of a notebook. The goals of this notebook are:

* Briefly present what are Topological Deep Learning (and Geometric Deep Learning) by providing some explanations, definitions, visuals, etc
* Present the potential applications in healthcare and some work that have been done so far in these emerging fields
* Run some code to get some hands-on experience

## Installation

Download manually the files or clone the repository using, for example, the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AdrienC21/workshop_tdl_healthcare.git
```

Then run the notebook `workshop_japan.ipynb`. You can run it on Google Colab.

If you don't want all the "solutions" and want some small coding exercises, run instead the notebook `workshop_japan_v2.ipynb`. You can run it on Google Colab too.
